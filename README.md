# wordpress-sass
This repository is intended to go with the underscore wordpress theme. Underscore is a started template for developing wordpress themes.
When generating an underscore theme, make sure to click `Advanced Options` and have `_sassify!` checked. For custom themes a `sass` folder should be created in the theme's root directory.
